# OIB-SIP Data Analytics Internship  
## Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project was completed as part of the AICTE OIB-SIP Data Analytics Internship.  
The objective of this task is to perform Sentiment Analysis on text data to classify sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective  

- To analyze text data  
- To preprocess textual content  
- To apply sentiment classification techniques  
- To visualize sentiment distribution  
- To extract meaningful insights from textual data  

---

## 📊 Dataset Description  

The dataset contains textual data such as:

- Customer reviews / feedback  
- Comments or text-based opinions  

Each text entry is analyzed to determine its sentiment polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
